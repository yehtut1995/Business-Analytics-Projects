# End-to-End Business Analysis for Hospital Operations Optimization

## Project Overview

This repository contains an **end-to-end Business Analyst capstone project** completed as part of the **IBM Business Analyst Professional Certificate**. The project focuses on improving operational efficiency in a multispecialty hospital by addressing key challenges such as long patient wait times, scheduling conflicts, inefficient resource allocation, and poor interdepartmental communication.

The project simulates a real-world healthcare environment and demonstrates the complete **business analysis lifecycle**, from problem identification and requirements gathering to data analysis, risk management, and solution recommendations.

## Business Problem

HealthFirst Care (simulated organization) faced multiple operational issues:

* Long patient wait times due to manual scheduling and check-in processes
* Frequent double bookings and appointment conflicts
* Lack of real-time visibility into staff, room, and equipment availability
* Communication gaps between departments affecting patient flow
* Fragmented legacy systems leading to incomplete records and inefficiencies

These challenges resulted in patient dissatisfaction, staff burnout, and reduced operational performance.

---

## Business Objectives

* Reduce average patient wait times by at least 20%
* Minimize appointment scheduling conflicts and double bookings
* Optimize utilization of clinical staff, rooms, and equipment
* Improve patient satisfaction through timely communication
* Enable real-time data sharing across departments
* Enhance staff productivity and operational efficiency

---

## Methodology & Key Activities

### Requirements Gathering & Management

* Developed a comprehensive **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
* Created a **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** aligned with business objectives
* Prioritized requirements using the **MoSCoW method**
* Defined functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria

### Stakeholder Analysis & Engagement

* Identified key stakeholders: patients, clinicians, administrative staff, IT teams, and hospital leadership
* Conducted stakeholder influence-interest analysis
* Designed stakeholder engagement and communication plans to support adoption and alignment

### Scope & Process Management

* Defined in-scope and out-of-scope activities
* Developed a detailed **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** with phased delivery
* Modeled **As-Is and To-Be processes** for appointment scheduling, check-in, and communication
* Created BPMN workflows and swimlane diagrams to clarify roles and responsibilities

---

## Data Analysis & Visualization

* Analyzed appointment, wait time, resource utilization, and patient feedback data using **Excel pivot tables**
* Identified peak hours, busiest days, underutilized and overburdened departments
* Examined the relationship between patient wait times and satisfaction scores
* Designed dashboards and charts to visualize:

  * Average patient wait times by department
  * Resource utilization patterns
  * Patient feedback distribution
  * Departmental efficiency heat maps

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

* Developed a detailed **Risk Register** covering operational, technical, and stakeholder risks
* Conducted **SWOT analysis** and risk prioritization using risk matrices
* Designed **risk mitigation and contingency plans** to ensure service continuity
* Identified automation, system integration, and training as key risk-reduction strategies

---

## Key Findings

* Manual scheduling and check-in processes are the primary drivers of long wait times
* Lack of real-time resource visibility causes overbooking and inefficiencies
* Communication gaps between departments delay patient flow and care delivery
* Longer wait times are strongly associated with lower patient satisfaction
* Operational risks have a greater impact than technical or stakeholder risks

---

## Recommendations

* Implement automated appointment scheduling with conflict detection
* Introduce digital or self-service patient check-in solutions
* Deploy real-time dashboards for resource tracking and workload balancing
* Integrate scheduling, billing, and patient record systems to eliminate data silos
* Support change adoption through staff training and phased implementation
