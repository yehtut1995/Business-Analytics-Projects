### Overview

This project demonstrates the use of UML modeling to represent the Patient Investigation and Treatment Process in a Clinic. The diagrams illustrate how a clinic manages patient care from registration to treatment and follow-up, showcasing typical workflows and system interactions. They are illustrated by using Lucidchart.

The portfolio includes:

Activity Diagram – Maps the step-by-step flow of patient investigation and treatment, from emergency assessment and registration to diagnosis, prescribed actions, and final summary.

Class Diagram – Defines the key entities (e.g., Patient, Physician, Nurse, Investigation, Prescribed Medicine, Performed Action) and their relationships, reflecting how information is structured and managed within the system.

This project showcases my ability to analyze healthcare workflows, document requirements, and translate them into structured UML representations. These models can be used as a foundation for designing healthcare information systems, improving process efficiency, and ensuring clarity for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
