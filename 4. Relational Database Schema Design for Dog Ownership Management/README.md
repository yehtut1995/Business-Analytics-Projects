### Project Overview: Relational Database Schema Design for Dog Ownership Management
This project demonstrates the design of a dog ownership and management system, starting with a UML class diagram to model key entities—Person, Organization, Ownership, and Dog—and their relationships, including breed-specific specializations. The conceptual model was then translated into a relational database schema with tables, primary keys, and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and support structured queries.

The project highlights the process of converting business requirements into a logical database design. Next steps for a business analyst could include refining requirements, defining detailed business rules, and creating queries, reports, or dashboards to illustrate how the database supports decision-making and user interactions.
