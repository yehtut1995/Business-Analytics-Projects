### Project Overview
This project models two essential Human Resource Management processes models in BPMN 2.0 using Bizagi.

### 1.Recruitment Process
This BPMN diagram outlines the end-to-end recruitment workflow starting from workforce planning to candidate selection. It covers:
Planning staffing needs
Opening job positions
Receiving and reviewing applications
Conducting interviews
Making job offers and issuing appointment letters
A decision gateway for candidate selection outcomes
Integration with the Employee Onboarding sub-process once a candidate is hired

### 2.Employee Onboarding Sub-process
This BPMN sub-process details the activities that ensure smooth integration of a new hire into the organization. It includes:
Arranging visa and travel formalities
Airport pickup and first-day induction
Provisioning IT resources (laptop, user ID, system access)
Recording employee onboarding details
Reporting the employee’s official joining

### Purpose of the Project
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how business process modeling can be applied to HR workflows, making them more transparent, structured, and ready for digital transformation. These BPMN diagrams can be used for:
Business process analysis and improvement
Automation readiness assessments
Training HR professionals on standardized workflows

### How to Use
Open the .bpmn files with a BPMN-compatible tool (e.g., Camunda Modeler, Signavio, or Bizagi)
Explore the recruitment and onboarding flows
Modify or extend the processes for organization-specific needs
